This is just a collection of tiny scripts I've written in the past that come in handy on a regular basis.  Thy're all licensed under GPL-3, so go nuts :-)

dejson

  Pipe output into this and suddenly it's more readable.

  Example: $ curl -s 'http://somesite.tld/path/to/resource.json' | dejson


deserialise

  Does the same as djson, but for PHP's serialize() function.

  Example: $ php somecommand.php | deserialise


highlight

  Highlight multiple strings in different colours.  Just pipe the output of a
  command through it and include the strings you'd like to see highlighted.
  Note that this also supports standard regular expressions, and supports up
  to 9 separate strings.

  Example: $ /path/to/some/command | highlight.py alpha bravo charlie delta echo foxtrot golf hotel india


sgrep

  Not really a drop-in replacement for grep, this script works only with an
  input stream (as opposed to handling options like -r) and does exactly
  what grep does, stripping out the stuff you don't want to see anyway:
  .svn stuff, .pyc, etc.


urldecode

  Translates a URL with lots of encoding into something more readable

  Example: $ echo "I%20am%20the%20walrus" | urlencode
  Example: $ cat /path/to/file | urlencode


urlencode

  Translates a string into URL-encoded data

  Example: $ echo "I am the walrus" | urlencode
  Example: $ cat /path/to/file | urldecode
